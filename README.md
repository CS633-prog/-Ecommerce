# Ecommerce Project: Click&GO.com #

Click&go is a website that consists of school supplies like Stationary, Dorm essentials, books and apparel. The site was designed in Python using the web framework named 'DJANGO'. We currently built a first iteration which allows you to access the website as an administrator and also create a user account.

As an administrator you can add/ remove shopping products, manage the users, add social accounts, etc. The checking out of products isn't available as of now and we are working to build and implement that application into our system.

The website was hosted using the AWS-server and can be viewed at http://54.167.39.79:7721 .
